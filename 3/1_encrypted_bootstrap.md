Now it's time to make the same changes to your bootstrap node.

Try it yourself
===============
 * Require noise in your bootstrap node and add `noise` to the `connEncryption` section of the configuration options for the bootstrap node.
 * Run the bootstrap and then dial it from the other node
 * You should now have a secure channel to communicate over!

 In the next chapter, we're going to take our secured communication worldwide and learn how to find other nodes to talk to on any network available!
